BITS N ATOMS - Sensing and Acting

Embodied Cognition
Rene Descartes: dualism (physical / soul). the body as the interface between the mind and physical surroundings.

Negative electrons attracted to positive protons, creating electromagnetism.

PROTONS = POSITIVE
ELECTRONS = NEGATIVE

Atoms tend to move toward equilibrium

Voltage / potential energy = refers to the difference in pressure between two points. This pressure exists even when there’s no flow - Spannung

Current = amount of electrons moving thru the material - Strohm

micro Amps 10 000 —> milli Amps 1 000 —> Amps 1
e.g. USB can move 2 Amps

Resistance = measure of restriction to the flow of electrons - Wiederstant
Unit of measurement is ohms
- calculate ohms using the coloured lines on the resistor

Watt = found by multiplying the voltage and the current. When a current passes thru a component, the voltage drops.

Watts = V x I (amps/current)

V = I x R
I = V/R

To work out the value of resistor needed:
R = V/I

Watt hours = W x H (hours in use)

DC = Direct Current - small voltages, most common
AC = Alternating current - larger voltages such as fridges, hydroponic power stations, wind turbines

ARDUINO
Converts Analog to Digital values

#define ledPin 11 //works identical to declaring a variable, no semicolon needed. Searches and replaces the ledPin term. Can't be changed throughout, communicates with the compiler rather the arduino itself

~ is PulseWidthModulator, and can divide into 255 increments.

Figure out the voltage between two resistors:


Vres = Vcc x R2/(R1 + R2)

Morovek complex?

unsigned long gives longer time

unsigned long timer = millis() - lastTime; gives the value we will use to control the LEDs

Transistors:
B = bass
C = collector
E = emitter

Communication Protocols

UART 
Tx = reading
Rx = writing
communicate between arduinos
only for two devices
daisy chain, not jumping the chain
requires fixed baud rate

I2C 
SCL = serial clock
SDA = serial data
used widely in the IoT
not super fast
short distance to communicate w sensors (5m)

SPI = Serial Peripheral Interface
13 = serial clock
12 = Master out slave in / MOSI
11 = Master in slave out / MISO
no limit to device aside from RAM and power supply

Neopixels
Individually addressable LED lights, in RGB colour.
GRB current = 0.036A
RGB current = 0.048A

I[A] = Amps x no.LEDs x meters

15m ws2812 x 60LED = 43.2 = 518Watts
5m x 30LED = 7.2 = 36Watts

P[W] = U[V]


Servo Motors
can only move 180 degrees
within 20 degrees when you control directly with myservo.write

H Bridge
Bridge of transistors?

can control two motors
