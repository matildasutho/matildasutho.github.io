We'll be using the Web Serial API - which allows websites to communicate to ports in your computer (USB etc). You'll need to use a chromium based browser - such as Chrome. 

The library will need to be added to the index.html file of your processing sketch, using this CDN:
 <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/makeabilitylab/p5js/_libraries/serial.js"></script>

To check if your browser supports web serial, you can open a console (cmd + option+ i on Mac or ctrl + alt + i on Windows) and type in:

await navigator.serial.requestPort();

If the browser supports it, you will see a pop-up window, where you can choose one of the ports with Arduino plugged in.

You can bypass this by opening and compiling the Arduino and p5 sketch, and clicking on the p5 canvas to select the port. 

You should be able to control the brightness of the sketch with the potentiometer. The data is being passed through the value dataIn - use this anywhere to make changes to your webpage via physical computing.

The sketch will break if you have Arduino's serial monitor open at the same, so the LEDs are a physical outcome to test that your Arduino is communicating with your computer.
