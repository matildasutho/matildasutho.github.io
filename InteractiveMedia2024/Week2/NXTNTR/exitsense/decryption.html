            “the ambition of critical theory is not just a restoration of the original … 
            but a transformation of the message, its radical reclamation and reinterpretation, 
            and the empowerment and broadening of the audience.”

            Numbers not per se revelatory. They are more like grains of material, wood, 
            stone, a sculpture. The design of the sculpture is not defined by its grains 
            but, even unseen as finished, move some- thing within artist's stroke. Whether 
            impulse, aesthetic or conceptual, decision is made. A small decision but 
            deliberate. It is code. The code-stroke the simple act of word in-form, code as 
            word.""
