There are bones
Of a poem which tug at heartstrings
And jerk tears from his eyes.
A medium since lost
To algorithms
And mechanical emotions

As he reads further it’s a list
A to do,
Some instructions yelling 
Don’t look back!
You must never look back.

To act without conscience,
Free from loyalty to a movement.

A way of life to live for himself
Always reaching for the highest shelf
With no possibility it could be any different
He denies that he plays any real, held 
part the red sea like moses -
A Divine child you’re told 
by Parents whose intentions are humane
Humane death is questionable in a world where 
We aren’t taught to question.

What we are taught
Is to consume
That we are prized, heroic pieces of a puzzle
That we are autonomous
And that they are wranglers

But there’s no mention of the bigger picture
The big ranch or
The Big data

A human centric perspective
Developed through lifetimes of
Inconsequential action toward
an inevitable
Destruction of our beloved 
Mother.

Sometimes I feel like a 
Motherless child
All alone with the world

We corral information
With no respect for its matter
Or its subject
Matter
The substance of matter
The quality of matter

Matter as a physical 
And as a digital
As though the two aren’t interconnected
As though the digital is independent
As though the essence of digital
Is so different to that which we can hold

His essence has been removed,
Whether he likes it or not
Without the wind
Or the rain
Or the sun
Or the seasons
What is really left?

The night

where the magic happens
People become shadows
Faceless, nameless, sexually
liberated

But for him
Theres a yellow fog
That rubs on window panes,
Licking its tongue into the corners of his evening
Haunting him
He walks faster
He must beat the night home
Be safe in bed, 
Curled up in the bosom of his
Wife.
Where he can dream

She is benediction
She is the root connection
She is connecting with me

He acts
He withdraws
He imports money into his drawers
And calls it a long day of data

He takes the money as a bonus
And that’s the worst part
Is that he takes.
And there’s no giving back
Because there’s no looking back.

Because to look back requires questions,
A discreet quest for 
More
To my point
Is that help is on its way.

The idea that it’s each man for himself
Forgets that the value of a group
Is
Greater than the sum of its parts.

If we’re all part
This
And part that
I’m part Cowgirl 
you’re part me
We’re all just 
Cowgirls
And we gotta sling too
